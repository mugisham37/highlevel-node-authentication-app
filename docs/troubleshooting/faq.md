# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## General Questions

### What is the Enterprise Authentication API?

The Enterprise Authentication API is a comprehensive, enterprise-grade authentication system built with Node.js and TypeScript. It provides:

- **Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)** - TOTP, SMS, Email, WebAuthn
- **OAuth2/OpenID Connect** - Google, GitHub, Microsoft providers
- **Passwordless Authentication** - WebAuthn, Magic Links
- **Advanced Security** - Zero-trust architecture, risk scoring, device fingerprinting
- **Session Management** - Redis-backed, concurrent session control
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** - Hierarchical permissions
- **Real-time Features** - WebSocket integration, event streaming
- **Enterprise Features** - Audit logging, compliance reporting, bulk operations

### What programming languages are supported?

We provide SDKs and examples for:

- **JavaScript/TypeScript** - Full-featured SDK with automatic token refresh
- **Python** - Complete SDK with async support
- **PHP** - SDK with Guzzle HTTP client support
- **cURL** - Comprehensive command-line examples
- **Java** - Basic structure (full SDK available via OpenAPI Generator)
- **C#** - Basic structure (full SDK available via NSwag)

### Is the API RESTful?

Yes, the API follows REST principles with:

- Resource-based URLs (`/users`, `/auth`, `/oauth`)
- Standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Proper HTTP status codes
- JSON request/response format
- Stateless design with JWT tokens

### What authentication methods are supported?

The API supports multiple authentication methods:

1. **Email/Password** - Traditional username/password authentication
2. **OAuth2/OpenID Connect** - Google, GitHub, Microsoft, custom providers
3. **Passwordless** - WebAuthn (FIDO2), magic links, biometric authentication
4. **Multi-Factor Authentication** - TOTP, SMS, email, hardware keys
5. **API Keys** - For service-to-service authentication

## Security Questions

### How secure is the API?

The API implements enterprise-grade security features:

- **Zero-trust architecture** - Every request is authenticated and authorized
- **JWT tokens** with secure signing and expiration
- **Argon2 password hashing** with secure parameters
- **Device fingerprinting** and risk scoring
- **Rate limiting** with dynamic limits based on risk assessment
- **HTTPS enforcement** with security headers (HSTS, CSP, etc.)
- **Input validation** and SQL injection prevention
- **Audit logging** with tamper protection
- **GDPR compliance** features

### How are passwords stored?

Passwords are hashed using **Argon2**, which is the winner of the Password Hashing Competition and recommended by security experts. The implementation uses:

- **Argon2id variant** for optimal security
- **Secure salt generation** using cryptographically secure random numbers
- **Appropriate time and memory parameters** for resistance against attacks
- **No plaintext storage** - passwords cannot be recovered, only reset

### What is the token expiration policy?

Token expiration follows security best practices:

- **Access tokens**: 1 hour (configurable)
- **Refresh tokens**: 30 days (configurable)
- **MFA challenge tokens**: 5 minutes
- **Password reset tokens**: 1 hour
- **Magic link tokens**: 15 minutes

Tokens are automatically refreshed by our SDKs when they expire.

### How does risk scoring work?

The API uses multiple factors to calculate risk scores (0-100):

- **Device fingerprinting** - Known vs unknown devices
- **Geolocation** - Unusual login locations
- **Behavioral patterns** - Login frequency, time patterns
- **Network analysis** - IP reputation, VPN detection
- **Account history** - Previous security incidents

Higher risk scores trigger additional security measures like MFA requirements.

## Integration Questions

### How do I get started?

1. **Read the [Quick Start Guide](../integration-guides/quick-start.md)**
2. **Get API credentials** from your administrator
3. **Choose your integration method**:
   - Use our SDKs for JavaScript, Python, or PHP
   - Use cURL examples for testing
   - Generate custom SDKs using OpenAPI specification
4. **Implement authentication flow** in your application
5. **Test in development environment**
6. **Deploy to production**

### Do you provide SDKs?

Yes, we provide official SDKs for:

- **JavaScript/TypeScript** - Full-featured with automatic token management
- **Python** - Complete SDK with type hints and async support
- **PHP** - SDK with PSR-7 compatibility

You can also generate SDKs for other languages using our OpenAPI specification with tools like:

- [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech/)
- [Swagger Codegen](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-codegen/)
- [NSwag](https://github.com/RicoSuter/NSwag) (for .NET)

### How do I handle token refresh?

Our SDKs handle token refresh automatically. For custom implementations:

```javascript
// Automatic retry with token refresh
async function apiRequest(url, options) {
  try {
    return await fetch(url, {
      ...options,
      headers: {
        ...options.headers,
        Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}`,
      },
    });
  } catch (error) {
    if (error.status === 401 && error.error === 'TOKEN_EXPIRED') {
      await refreshAccessToken();
      return await fetch(url, {
        ...options,
        headers: {
          ...options.headers,
          Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}`,
        },
      });
    }
    throw error;
  }
}
```

### Can I use the API with mobile apps?

Yes, the API is designed for mobile applications:

- **PKCE support** for OAuth2 flows in mobile apps
- **Device fingerprinting** adapted for mobile devices
- **Biometric authentication** via WebAuthn
- **Push notifications** for MFA (via webhooks)
- **Offline token validation** using JWT public keys

### How do I implement OAuth2 integration?

See our [OAuth Integration Guide](../integration-guides/oauth-integration.md) for detailed instructions. The basic flow is:

1. **Initiate OAuth flow**: `POST /oauth/initiate`
2. **Redirect user** to provider authorization URL
3. **Handle callback**: `POST /oauth/callback`
4. **Store tokens** and user information

### What about webhooks?

The API supports webhooks for real-time event notifications:

- **User events** - login, logout, registration, profile changes
- **Security events** - failed logins, account locks, MFA setup
- **Administrative events** - user creation, role changes
- **Custom events** - application-specific events

See our [Webhook Integration Guide](../integration-guides/webhook-integration.md) for setup instructions.

## Technical Questions

### What are the rate limits?

Rate limits vary by endpoint and user tier:

- **Public endpoints**: 100 requests/minute
- **Authenticated endpoints**: 1000 requests/minute
- **Administrative endpoints**: 500 requests/minute
- **OAuth endpoints**: 50 requests/minute

Rate limits are enforced per IP address and user account. Higher limits are available for enterprise customers.

### What HTTP status codes are used?

The API uses standard HTTP status codes:

- **200 OK** - Successful request
- **201 Created** - Resource created successfully
- **400 Bad Request** - Invalid request data
- **401 Unauthorized** - Authentication required
- **403 Forbidden** - Insufficient permissions
- **404 Not Found** - Resource not found
- **409 Conflict** - Resource conflict (e.g., duplicate email)
- **429 Too Many Requests** - Rate limit exceeded
- **500 Internal Server Error** - Server error

### How do I handle errors?

All error responses follow a consistent format:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "ERROR_CODE",
  "message": "Human-readable error message",
  "details": {
    "field": "specific error details"
  },
  "correlationId": "req_123456789"
}
```

Always check the `success` field and handle errors appropriately:

```javascript
try {
  const response = await client.login(email, password);
  if (response.success) {
    // Handle success
  } else {
    // Handle API error
    console.error(`Error: ${response.error} - ${response.message}`);
  }
} catch (error) {
  // Handle network or other errors
  console.error('Request failed:', error.message);
}
```

### Can I use the API in serverless environments?

Yes, the API works well with serverless architectures:

- **Stateless design** - No server-side sessions required
- **JWT tokens** - Self-contained authentication
- **HTTP-based** - Works with any HTTP client
- **Fast cold starts** - Optimized for serverless performance

Consider using connection pooling and caching for optimal performance in serverless environments.

### What about CORS?

CORS is configured to allow requests from authorized origins. For development:

- **localhost** origins are allowed
- **Custom origins** can be configured

For production, ensure your domain is added to the allowed origins list.
