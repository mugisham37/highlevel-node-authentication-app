# Fullstack Monolith Transformation - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the complete transformation of the current Node.js authentication API project into a comprehensive fullstack monolith architecture. The transformation will extract shared packages from the existing API, create new frontend applications (web and mobile), establish proper workspace management, and implement enterprise-grade development and deployment infrastructure.

The goal is to create a production-ready, scalable fullstack application that maintains the sophisticated authentication features while enabling code sharing, type safety across the stack, and independent development of different application layers.
