# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for an enterprise-grade authentication backend system built on Node.js with TypeScript. The system serves as a universal authentication layer capable of integrating with any application through well-defined APIs, webhooks, and event streams. It implements zero-trust security architecture, supports multiple OAuth providers (Google, GitHub, Microsoft), and provides advanced features including multi-factor authentication, passwordless authentication, and sophisticated session management.

The system follows a monolithic architecture with clean separation of concerns, utilizing both Prisma and Drizzle ORMs for optimal performance across different use cases. It's designed to handle enterprise-scale authentication requirements while maintaining sub-100ms response times and supporting thousands of concurrent requests.
