- System events (errors, suspicious activity)
- User management events (CRUD operations)

**Pre-configured Instances:**

- `standardAuditLogger` - General purpose logging
- `securityAuditLogger` - Security-focused logging
- `complianceAuditLogger` - Compliance-ready logging

### 6. Security Headers Middleware (`src/infrastructure/server/middleware/security-headers.ts`)

**Features:**

- Content Security Policy (CSP) with violation reporting
- HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)
- Comprehensive security headers
- CSP nonce generation for inline scripts
- Permissions Policy configuration
- Cross-Origin policies (COEP, COOP)

**Security Headers:**

- `Content-Security-Policy` - Prevents XSS and injection attacks
- `Strict-Transport-Security` - Enforces HTTPS
- `X-Frame-Options` - Prevents clickjacking
- `X-Content-Type-Options` - Prevents MIME sniffing
- `Referrer-Policy` - Controls referrer information
- `Permissions-Policy` - Restricts browser features

**Pre-configured Instances:**

- `standardSecurityHeaders` - Balanced security
